# Telegram-proxy-UI
An auto-upgrade UI for proxies used in Telegram. It's free and open software.

## How to use?
Just follow the link of [webpage](https://mohammadjr7.github.io/Telegram-proxy-ui/) and choose one proxy to us; after that either click on "CONNECT" button to add that proxy directly to Telegram or click on "Copy to clipboard" to copy the proxy information to the clipboard.

## What to do after "Copy to clipboard"?
After the information of the proxy server is copied, you can either send that to yourself and click it to send Telegram a signal that you want to connect to that server, then press "Connect" or you can send it to a friend.

# Common Problems
1. The page is loading and it doesn't show anything!
Try refreshing the page and if does not work, try hard refresh it with `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `R`.
2. The page loads, but it's too slow.
Try the [light version](https://mohammadjr7.github.io/Telegram-proxy-ui/light.html) of the webpage to see if it helps.
